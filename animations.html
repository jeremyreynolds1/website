		<p>Below is a sample of an animation script that I built during my time at Diversys Learning</p>
		<p>It's a very simple library that runs through images in a directory after a custom delay</p>
		<p>The backbone of this library is jQuery. jQuery makes all of this possible</p>
		<div style="width:425px; height:425px;"  id="images">
		<img id="image1" style="width:425px; height:425px;" src="/pictures/01.png">
	</div>
