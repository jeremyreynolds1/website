			<h2>
				My Philosophy
			</h2>
			<p>
				I have always believed in a certain kind of code. It's things that we already know and things that we should follow:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Treat others the way you want to be treated</li>
					<li>Always deal with others honestly</li>
					<li>Always do your best work no matter what you are doing</li>
					<li>When working on a team, take into account other people's opinions</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
				These core values make up who I am. I love working with other people and being able to work in a workplace where I can bounce ideas off of my teammates. I think the ability to work in a team is the best way to get things done efficiently and effectively.
