				In the Spring of 2013, I entered Texas Woman's University's annual Research Symposium with a friend of mine, Emma Zemler. Our project was over Cluster Computing. Please see our research over it below.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Cluster Computer that we used was LittleFe. The idea behind our project was the simple principle of the more resources that there are, the faster a problem can be solved. We started with a simulation and timed how long the simulation took based on the resources available. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Our findings were that if the problem is simple and you allow multiple processors to run, things get backed up. If the problem is complex enough, multiple processors can help to make that problem simpler.
